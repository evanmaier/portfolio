        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I'm an Electrical Engineering graduate from the University of Victoria, now based in Vancouver Canada. 
          My professional experience is in embedded systems and firmware development, however I'm interested in all areas of Software Engineering.
        </p>
        <p>
          At UVic's Centre for Aerospace Research, I developed firmware for satellite radio systems, and at Open Ocean Robotics, I engineered software for autonomous surface vehicles.
          I'm always learning new skills, and have endeavored everything from firmware to frontend development.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I'm not working you can find me playing soccer, making music, and exploring the outdoors. I'm always looking for new challenges in my professional and personal life.
